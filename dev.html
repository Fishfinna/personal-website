                When I went to highschool I had the choice between a few different options, and eventually decided on Timberline as they offered a program called the HackerSpace, and baby wanna be hacker me was fascinated by it.
                In this program I got basically free access to learn anything that I wanted to, and was provided tools and tutorials on how to do it. While I did the odd bit of python or HTML from time to time. My main interests were in the 3D animation and graphic design fields.
